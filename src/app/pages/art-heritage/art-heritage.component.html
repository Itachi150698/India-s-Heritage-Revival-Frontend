                <h2>Our Indian Heritage Art </h2>
                <p>Similarly, stories embedded in Indian traditional art inform our collective memory, how we as a
                    society remember our past, or how we pick what is worth taking forward that involves a degree of
                    choice in remembrance and interpretation. With this choice, we make our cultural self, how we see
                    ourselves as a part of a community, nation, or even our shared humanity. Having said that, we can
                    not see works of traditional art merely as beautiful objects. They, in their material form,
                    encompass significant events, along with narratives they convey and stories they tell, and this is
                    how we as a society continue to engage with our heritage.

                    Heritage is about processes, relationships, values, and the meanings communities attach to their
                    surroundings. Therefore, when we talk about preserving Indian traditional art, it must go beyond
                    merely promoting artworks. Real preservation is about safeguarding the cultural memory and 
                    meaning-making processes embedded within each art form. In this way, traditional art will strengthen
                    community identity while encouraging its unique cultural expression. This cultural expression should
                    help us explore art forms’ cultural and historical evolution and learn how artists engage with their
                    inherited craft.

                    Though archaeology tends to focus on the antique aspect of historic and archaeological materials, we
                    can not confine heritage to the past alone. Heritage accumulates over time, engages with various
                    generations, and continues to evolve in the present. It paints an intimate connection with social,
                    economic, political, and daily aspects of people’s lives, serving as a living aspect of shared
                    history and values that sometimes make them a site of contention. Therefore, when engaging with
                    heritage, whether it’s a monument, museum, or art gallery, it’s crucial to consider the role it
                    plays in shaping cultural relationships in the present.</p>

                    <p>Painting is an ancient art form that uses various mediums to create visual representations. It

                        <p class="second-clr text-center">Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila art, has its origins
                            deeply rooted in the rich cultural heritage of the Mithila region in Bihar, India. The art
                            form traces its beginnings to ancient times, where it was traditionally practiced by women
                            in the region. The name "Madhubani" derives from "Madhu" (meaning honey) and "bani" (meaning
                            forest or woods), reflecting the lush, natural surroundings that inspired its early motifs.

                            The origins of Madhubani painting are often attributed to the epic times of Ramayana, where
                            it is believed that King Janaka, Sita's father, ordered his kingdom to decorate the walls of
                            his palace with intricate paintings to celebrate her marriage to Lord Rama. Over time, this
                            artistic tradition evolved and expanded beyond palace walls, becoming a cherished practice
                            among women in Mithila. </p>

                            outside of Mumbai. Despite being close to one of the largest cities in India, the Warli
                            reject much of contemporary culture. The style of Warli painting was not recognised until
                            the 1970s, even though the tribal style of art is thought to date back as early as 10th
                            century A.D. The Warli culture is centered around the concept of Mother Nature and elements
                            of nature are often focal points depicted in Warli painting. Farming is their main way of
                            life and a large source of food for the tribe. They greatly respect nature and wildlife for
                            the resources that they provide for life.]Warli artists use their clay huts as the backdrop
                            for their paintings, similar to how ancient people used cave walls as their canvases.</p>

                                    symmetry. This art form played a central role in classical antiquity and has

                                    its representation of the human body, its exploration of mythological and historical
                                    themes, and its emphasis on artistic principles such as balance and harmony.</p>

                                    Stoneware is a type of pottery that is known for its durability and versatility,
                                    making it suitable for both functional and decorative items. It is distinguished by
                                    its firing process, which occurs at higher temperatures, typically ranging from
                                    1,200 to 1,300 degrees Celsius (about 2,192 to 2,372 degrees Fahrenheit). This
                                    high-temperature firing results in a dense, vitrified material that is less porous
                                    and more robust compared to other types of pottery like earthenware.</p>
